In order to contribute, you would pick an issue describing a bug or a wanted feature from the github integrated board and create a branch for your contribution. The branch name format should be a noun or an adjective_noun, followed by _fix for a bug solution (e.g. parallel_parking, driving, car_detecting_fix).

While developing your contribution, commit frequently and with a descriptive message each time (i.e. no "fixing stuff", but instead "refactoring variable names" or "correcting an accidental endless loop"). When you have completed your addition of code, you must create a pull request before anything can be added to master. The pull request is then peer reviewed before it can be merged into master branch.
