## DIT168 V18 Project: Industrial IT and Embedded Systems

The group will during the spring term of 2018 design and implement software for a mini car to drive autonomously under stable conditions. The car should be able to, in addition to self-driving, follow a line, do safe handling of intersections, pass other vehicles and park. To accomplish this the car is equipped with sensors. The project will be done in C/C++ with focus on quality assurance, effective design and testing throughout. 

### GITHUB LAYOUT:

We will be using individual branches per feature; theyâ€™ll be merged using pull requests that have to approved by at least one other group member. There shall be no direct pushes to the master branch; prototypes will only evolve by pulling completed features into the release branch. In addition to the feature branches, each contributor creates a separate branch from the feature branch for which they push their code to.
