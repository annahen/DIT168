## DIT168 V18 Project: Industrial IT and Embedded Systems

During the spring term of 2018 - and as part of DIT168 V18 at the University of Gothenburg, this repository will be used to design and implement software for a mini car to drive autonomously under stable conditions. The car should be able to, in addition to self-driving, follow a line, do safe handling of intersections, pass other vehicles and park. To accomplish this the car is equipped with sensors. The project will be done in C/C++ and built upon [OpenDaVINCI](http://opendavinci.cse.chalmers.se/www/) - with a high focus on quality assurance, effective design and testing throughout. 

### GIT LAYOUT:

Please keep individual branches per feature in mind; theyâ€™ll be merged using pull requests that have to approved by at least one other contributor/ group member. There shall be no direct pushes to the master branch; prototypes will only evolve by pulling completed features into the release branch. In addition to the feature branches, each contributor creates a separate branch from the feature branch for which they push their code to.\
\
Following the original folder structure, please make sure to place all generated code and/ or supporting files within the right directory - which, in general means:\
\
Within the `src/` folder for anything code related; within additional sub-directories (keeping precise naming in mind) per feature (e.g. `src/networking/` for anything network related); and within supporting `test/` and `demo/` sub-directories for inherent demos and tests accordingly.

### CLONING
`$ git clone https://github.com/gusbocju/DIT168.git`
